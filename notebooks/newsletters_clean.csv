The report found that 122,000 children are living in destitution, accounting for 60% of young people supported by frontline workers. This is up from 45% in just 12 months. Researchers spoke to more than 1,200 workers who help children in poverty. Six in 10 of supported children are falling behind at school, with the charity warning: ""Education is becoming a luxury that some families can no longer prioritise, because it is no longer a given that families can sustain basic needs, such as a warm roof over their heads or regular food to eat."" Professionals also said 70% of children living in poverty have mental health problems. Buttle UK has called on ministers to lift the two-child Universal Credit limit and bring in an 'Essentials Guarantee' which would link Universal Credit to cost of essentials and the number of people in a household. It also called for a dedicated Cabinet minister for children and young people to be appointed.

Analysis showed the total number of persistently absent pupils rose again to 1.89m, two and a half times the number that regularly missed school before the pandemic. The figures show that 7.5% of school days were missed in English state schools in the academic year from autumn 2022 to summer 2023, a rise of a 60% compared with 2018-19's overall absence rate of 4.7%. In state primary schools the absence rate doubled to 6% from 3% in 2018-19, while in state secondary schools the rate was 9.3%, compared with 5.5% in the year before the onset of the pandemic. Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said: ""School attendance is just as important on the last day of term as it is on the first. It's encouraging to see more children in school this year than last, but there is still more work to be done. Barriers to children attending school are wide and varied. We are supporting parents and teachers year-round to make sure children are in classrooms and ready to learn.""

The number of children missing school has increased by 200,000 within the last 12 months, reaching 1.8m for the academic year 2022/23. The rise is attributed to rising mental health issues among children, particularly anxiety, as well as unmet needs of children with special educational needs.
